# CSS Grid
### It works in IE11, I promise

<Notes>

- Today I'm going not going to teach you how to use CSS Grid.

- I'm going to talk about some use cases for how I have used it, why you might like to try it out, and how to support grid in ie11.

import gridbible from './img/gridbible.jpg'


## But how do I use grid?

<img src={gridbible} />


<Notes>

- There are tons of resources and tutorials out there that do a great job explaining grid.

- I'll be linking to several resources throughout, which you can find on the last slide.

- I personally find myself referencing the CSS tricks doc the most since it's familiar to me like the flexbox doc

- If you need more help, I'm always happy to work through a grid problem one on one

- I've also put some CarGurus specific resources in our codepen account for you to play with

import support from './img/support.jpg'

<img src={support} />

<Notes>

- I want to talk about browser support first to get this out of the way
- You can see that modern browsers are all in the green.
- But we still need to worry about ie11 for desktop, so what does that mean for us?

</Notes>

import { Appear } from 'mdx-deck'
import ie11 from './img/ie11.gif'

<img src={ie11} />

<ul>
    <Appear>
        <li>If you're only developing specifically for mobile, carry on</li>
        <li>If you have a specific number of columns and rows, carry on</li>
        <li>*If your content is more dynamic and you need to support desktop, find an alternate solution (probably flex)</li>
    </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>

- ie11 has partial support which means it uses an older CSS grid spec than modern browsers

- The main difference here is that ie11 doesn't support implicit grid rows, only explicit

- Read through the bullets

import welovecssgrid from './img/welovecssgrid.jpg'

<img src={welovecssgrid} />

<ul>
    <li>Fast to develop with</li>
    <li>Helps bridge the gap between design and develop</li>
    <li>*Less markup</li>
</ul>


<Notes>

- So we've talked about support for ie11, and you might be wondering why use grid at all?

- It makes drawing up a UI incredibly Fast

- You can have an entire layout built in a few minutes

- It allows us to be more precise with our designs

- You can nudge things around in the inspector instantly, rework entire layouts/spacing and order

- Generally use less markup than with flex. Flex sometimes leads to multiple wrapper divs to accomplish what you want, and with grid you can be more orderly with your markup.

<Notes>

- Speaking of flexbox, I've seen a few arguments about CSS Grid vs. flexbox

- You can read more about it from Jen Simmons or Rachel Andrews

- The conversation shouldn't be about which one is better- they each have a time and a place

import flexinsidegrid from './img/flexinsidegrid.jpg'

<img src={flexinsidegrid} />

<Notes>

- Not only that, but they work beautifully together. Sometimes you might want to flex inside your grid

- You can see an example of this on our mobile listing blades where we display the dealer reviews in the same row as dealer location

- Flexing between and using margin-left: auto; translates to "if we don't have a dealer review, allow the dealer location to grow and fill the entire row"

- I personally found flex really helpful for the listing blade when I started testing in international markets- setting a specific grid box is challenging with text that is variable in length

</Notes>

<Notes>

- to wrap things up, I'm going to show you two use cases for css grid: one that doesn't work for ie11, and one that does

- We'll talk about why the decision to use grid was made

- And I'll be showing you demos using BrowserStack and explain how to use autoprefixer

</Notes>

## Case #1: A table of dynamic content

<Notes>

- Here's a design for the new listing stats section on mobile VDP

- Theron developed this ask him why

- Since we don't always know the amount of rows, this simply cannot be done on ie11 (not easily, at least)

- Show the codepen debug view (explain that) and open browserstack to show the overlay

</Notes>

## Case #2: A beautiful new design for the Used Car page

<Notes>

- Here's a design for the new Used Car page

- When you look at a design like this the grid is very clear

- I had this layout practically complete before the mocks were finalized

- I knew I wanted to set this up in a 12 column grid, I knew how many sections I needed, so I created a for placement only class and threw it all together

- When I first started writing the markup, I relied on implicit rows. This allowed me to move really quickly and watch things magically fall into place

- As I started testing in ie11, obviosly this didn't work

- After doing a lot of research and reading this article about 500 times, I found a solution that works

- Using grid-template is the most explicit way to set up your grid- its clear for ie11, but its also very clear to read in the CSS

- This is my recommendation for writing grid markup
